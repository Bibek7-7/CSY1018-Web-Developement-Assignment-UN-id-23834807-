    <div><article class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">Learning how to work with css grid and it amazing features to distribute the layout through the page.learning css and html basic was little bit fun. Desiging layout with just few of the tools was some kind of inner happiness.Working with just some of the css basic we can create and ordinary layout i wonder what can we do if we know far more we know at right now. Now at last there were a little bit ups and downs beacuse of my negelence.Havent been present class regularly due to hand burn.Havent been in any kind of computer things.So just know a little bit of python basic how it basic funcation works like if and else:: so it was faster to learn html and css basis to just create a simple layout.</article></div>

    <div><article class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">Learning of div method was kind of intresting.Module expereience was little good. Learning as the patrical live examples kind of give hopes rather than in networking....Learing about different different section and uses of it but which i havent use in my pages..learning about adding text animation to any kind of p or article which i have appiled to most of the pages which i am going to apply on this one was a happy learning.. </article></div>

    <div><article>As you can see the upper pictures if have download the pictures from git hub.You can 3 pictures of the layout which were totally different than submitting this one beacuse i was just tring stuff.I have fully changed the layout from the upper pictures .It wasnt good looking though it was full of black and white text which looks cool.Doesnt have enough to talk about just let me finish layout color choosing as you can learn from my code there is nothing much just css grid and distributing the layout .so the color choosing was simple black beacuse it looks so simple and good with some white text another one abouts fonts i havent choosen any color to specify design but in the portfilo as you can see project task was little bit inspired from youtube shorts doesnt know his name just random.. There is nothing much see it is the simple layout with some black color white text picture</article></div>
